# CAPSULE AMPLIFIER
Big buffalo Mic is an electronic board to amplify an electret or an condenser capsule Microphone. 

You will find in this repo all the documentation to build a very good quality Mic based on a BM-800 or 700 body.

This works is inspired by DJJULES https://www.instructables.com/True-Condenser-OPA-Mics/ . The main improvement is that all the components are in SMD , PCB is double sided. I've changed the regulator is now made with a cpacitance multiplier and two 6.8V zener diode to improve a bit the dynamic range of the mic.

The amplifier part is on the TOP COPPER of the PCB and the voltage mutiplier part is on the BOTTOM COPPER of the same PCB.
Mean than with the same PCB you can build a Cardioid or Figure 8 Mic, All in one single PCB

For an Electret Cardioïd MIC :
Electret capsule : JLI-2555BXZ3-GP or JLI-3412. I found the 3412 too bassy, and less sensitive than a condenser capsule

For a Condenser Cardioïd/Figure 8, Mic you will need the voltage multiplier of the bottom PCB

Condenser Capsules : TSC-1 or TSC-2

Capsule Sadle :https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4753082

Capsules are availaible on https://www.jlielectronics.com or https://micbooster.com/
Some condenser capsules are available on EBAY too.

In all cases you NEED a 48V phantom power supply to use this kind of mic.
