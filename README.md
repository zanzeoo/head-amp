# CAPSULE AMPLIFIER
Big buffalo Mic is an electronic board to amplify an electret or an condenser capsule Microphone. 

You will find in this repo all the documentation to build a very good quality Mic based on a BM-800 or 700 body.

The amplifier part is on the TOP COPPER of the PCB and the mutiplier part is on the BOTTOM COPPER of the same PCB.
Mean than with the same PCB you can build a Cardioid or Figure 8 Mic.

For an Electret Cardioïd MIC : BOM: https://octopart.com/bom-tool/cNtJgWeH
Electret capsule : JLI-2555BXZ3-GP or JLI-3412

For a Condenser Cardioïd/Figure 8, Mic you will need the voltage multiplier of the bottom PCB
Condenser Capsules : TSC-1 or TSC-2
BOM:

Capsules are availaible on https://www.jlielectronics.com or https://micbooster.com/
Some condenser capsules are available on EBAY too.

In all cases you NEED a 48V phantom power supply to use this kind of mic.
