# CAPSULE AMPLIFIER
This projets is an electronic board to amplify an electret or a true condenser capsule Microphone. 

You will find here all the documentation to build a very good quality Mic based on a BM-800 or 700 body.

This work is inspired by DJJULES https://www.instructables.com/True-Condenser-OPA-Mics/ . The main improvement is that all the components are SMD and PCB is double sided. I've changed the regulator, is now made with a capacitance multiplier and two  zener diode to improve a bit the dynamic range of the mic.

The amplifier part is on the TOP COPPER of the PCB (Channel 1 & 2) and the voltage mutiplier part is on the BOTTOM COPPER of the same PCB.
Mean than with the same PCB you can build a Cardioid or Figure 8 Mic, All in one single PCB


For a Cardio√Ød MIC, you just need one channel (channel 1 is populated but not channel 2 )
and the voltage multiplier if a condenser capsule is used.

For a Figure 8 stereo Mic you will need both channels and the voltage multiplier (bottom PCB)
Then a 5 pins xlr male connector : https://www.ebay.fr/itm/192576751560?var=492699131094 
and a special cable : https://www.thomann.de/fr/superlux_stereo_signal_cable.htm
This mic uses 2 input ports of your sound card but it gives you 2 independents tracks you can play with. (sums, Phase,soustration, delay...ect)

Condenser Capsules : TSC-1,TSC-2 or the RK47,CK12 expensive capsules

Electret capsule : JLI-2555BXZ3-GP or JLI-3412. I found the 3412 too bassy and less sensitive than a condenser capsule

Capsule Sadle :https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4753082
Capsules are Glued on the sadle with epoxy resin

Grommets: KOP36851 https://www.ebay.fr/itm/202458640190

Capsules are availaible on https://www.jlielectronics.com or https://micbooster.com/

Some cheaper chinese condenser capsules are available on EBAY too and gives very good results.

BOM: https://octopart.com/bom-tool/oiFaGxXk
In all cases you NEED a 48V phantom power supply to use this kind of mic.

Here some tests (It's not me in this videos :-) )
